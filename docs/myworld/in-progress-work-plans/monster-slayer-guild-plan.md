- `docs/myworld/in-progress-work-plans/dragon-gear-crafting-plan.md`

Source policy:

- This is the only official Monster Slayer implementation plan.
- `docs/myworld/rough-drafts/slayer-guild-rough-draft-plan.md` is superseded
  historical context, not an implementation source.
- Do not restore the rough draft's monster-drop/certificate turn-ins.
- Do not restore its dragon plate-leg, dragon-skirt, or other finished dragon
  armor rewards. Finished dragon equipment remains owned by the dragon gear
  crafting plan.

## Product Contract

Monster Slayer is an independently authored distributed guild-standing system.
Combat Odyssey supplies inspiration, legacy flavor, and migration evidence;
its tiers, task order, rewards, and progression are not a Monster Slayer
blueprint and must not be translated one-to-one. Monster Slayer is not a
visible skill and does not award Slayer XP. Players advance through seven named
ranks through one continuous mandatory guild quest, complete deterministic
assignment chains at six contacts, and then use those contacts for repeatable
tasks and rank-gated challenge shops. The opening assignment is deliberately
not a monster kill: it is the joke beer errand that starts the quest and awards
the first rank.

The intended tone and progression remain:

- An unstamped player brings a beer from the Rising Sun Barmaid to a dedicated
  Monster Slayer contact in the pub and receives a deliberately silly
  `Fledgling` hand stamp.
- Six fixed task chains advance the player through `Initiate`, `Veteran`,
  `Elite`, `Champion`, `Hero`, and `Legend`.
- Completed contacts offer repeatable random kill tasks for that contact's
  typed challenge currency: Fledgling, Initiate, Veteran, Elite, Champion, or
  Hero points.
- Biggum Flodrot's personality and the idea of a legendary capstone survive,
  but the 101-task Odyssey is no longer a required 40,906-kill reward wall.
- Challenge shops primarily turn hunting into useful combat preparation items
  that can otherwise come from skilling: weapons, armor, potions, food,
  ammunition, and similar supplies. Optional unique rewards can provide
  longer-term goals without making every shop item unique.

Core rules:

- One active Monster Slayer task across all contacts.
- The beer is a one-time introduction, not a repeatable material turn-in.
- Mandatory chains are fixed and cannot be cancelled or rerolled.
- Repeatables use rank-appropriate family pools and award the currency assigned
  to their contact/challenge level without advancing rank.
- Challenge points are awarded on task completion, not per kill. They are six
  non-interchangeable balances, not one scalar balance. This bounds cache
  writes, avoids partial-task farming, and makes the economy auditable.
- Reward costs are vectors. A higher challenge shop may require its native
  currency plus selected lower currencies, but never a currency above the
  reward's shop tier.
- Higher contacts refuse assignment/shop access until the required rank and the
  host guild's normal access requirements are satisfied.
- Existing Combat Odyssey state is migrated once without deleting its keys.

Non-goals:

- No new skill, XP curve, skill-guide entry, material proof, certificates, or
  trade-in ledger.
- No dragon plate mail legs, dragon scale mail legs, dragon skirts, or other
  finished dragon equipment in tasks, shops, migration grants, or capstones.
- No broad rewrite of NPC death, loot, XP, quest kill triggers, or party combat
  in the foundation branch.
- No automatic conversion of the old JSON's item rewards into shop stock.
- No one-to-one mapping from Odyssey tiers/tasks/rewards to Monster Slayer
  ranks, chains, balances, categories, or stock.

## Design Decision Ledger

This ledger distinguishes settled refinements from questions that remain open.
The implemented foundation data remains an informed starting point wherever a
later decision has not replaced it.

### Confirmed: One Continuous Mandatory Quest And Beer Opening

- The entire mandatory path from recruitment through the top `Legend` rank is
  one long Monster Slayer Guild quest, not six unrelated miniquests. Contact
  changes and rank awards are stages within that quest. Repeatable assignments
  and challenge-shop purchases are not additional mandatory quest stages.
- The initial contact opens with: `Are you my new recruit?`
- The player responses are:
  - `Yes, of course I am!`
  - `New recruit? No idea what you're talking about`
- Choosing the second response ends the dialogue without starting the quest or
  changing Monster Slayer state.
- Choosing the first response begins the quest and leads into the opening joke
  assignment:

  `Your first task is one of the most difficult monsters of all. You must slay
  my thirst. Quickly, to the barmaid and fetch me a beer!`

- The speaker is a new dedicated Monster Slayer NPC placed in the Rising Sun,
  not Barmaid `142`. The existing Barmaid remains the person from whom the
  player obtains the beer.
- On return, the player may either offer the beer or say they do not have it
  yet. Saying they do not have it ends the exchange without changing state. If
  they choose to offer it without actually carrying a beer, the contact tells
  them they have not got the beer yet and does not advance the quest.
- Offering a carried beer consumes one beer and completes the introduction with
  this exchange:

  - Contact: `Excellent, I dub thee an official fledgling Monster Slayer. Hold
    out your hand for your official stamp`
  - Player: `Do I get an official badge as well or something?`
  - Contact: `Nope, just the stamp`
  - Player: `This feels cheap`
  - Contact: `It's an honor. Return to me any time you wish to continue hunting
    monsters!`

- Completing the beer assignment awards `Fledgling`, after which talking to
  this same contact offers the first actual mandatory monster assignment.
- During the entire first Fledgling mandatory batch, dialogue presents only
  the current assignment and the promise that persistent work earns the next
  rank. It does not yet introduce challenge points, repeatable random
  assignments, or the challenge shop.
- Completing that first batch is the teaching/unlock moment for the distinction
  between fixed mandatory rank assignments and optional randomized point
  assignments, and for the Fledgling challenge shop.
- This decision does not yet replace a `MonsterSlayer.json` monster entry: the
  beer introduction is represented by the separate intro state. The later
  player-visible implementation must synchronize the confirmed dialogue and
  single-quest lifecycle; the current foundation intentionally has no dialogue
  or quest registration. It must also add the dedicated NPC definition and
  spawn and replace the foundation JSON's current Falador contact ID `142` with
  that NPC's stable ID.

### Confirmed: Fledgling Assignments And Initiate Reveal

The first monster batch deliberately stays with creatures rather than people.
Goblins are the opening exception to the non-humanoid preference. Exact NPC IDs
keep the early and late versions of otherwise identically named creatures from
collapsing into one task.

| Order | Assignment wording | Counted NPC IDs and repository combat levels | Kills |
| ---: | --- | --- | ---: |
| 1 | Goblins | Goblin `62` (level 7) | 40 |
| 2 | Young giant spiders | Giant Spider `23` (level 8) | 40 |
| 3 | Tougher goblins | Goblins `4,153,154` (level 13) | 50 |
| 4 | Large rats | Rats `47,177` (level 13) | 50 |
| 5 | Scorpions | Scorpion `70` (level 21) | 45 |
| 6 | Bears | Bears `8,188` (levels 24 and 26) | 45 |
| 7 | Desert wolves | Desert Wolf `721` (level 31) | 15 |
| 8 | Black unicorns | Black Unicorn `296` (level 31) | 12 |
| 9 | Giant spiders (level 31) | Giant Spider `74` (level 31) | 10 |

The batch is nine assignments and 307 kills. The level-13-to-21 gap is
intentional: repository inventory found no broadly accessible, non-humanoid
middle target. Dungeon Rats `367` are concentrated in Clock Tower and
Underground Pass spaces and must not become an implicit quest gate. Cows are
livestock; dwarves and dark wizards conflict with the creature-focused tone;
Poison Scorpions introduce an inappropriate cure requirement at this rank.

The three final assignments are short environmental trials rather than grind
counts. Desert Wolves require Shantay Pass and desert-heat preparation. All ten
active Black Unicorn spawns are in the Wilderness. Five of seven level-31 Giant
Spider spawns are in the Wilderness and the other two are isolated underground.
The task giver must warn the player clearly about desert preparation and
Wilderness exposure before assigning those stages; the danger is intentional,
not hidden accessibility debt.

After the ninth kill task, the contact:

- congratulates the player for doing a fine job culling the monsters, despite
  there appearing to be just as many monsters as before;
- advances the player from `Fledgling` to `Initiate` and presents proof of the
  new rank as a sticker that can supposedly be displayed wherever the player
  chooses;
- explains through comedic banter that hand stamps have been retired because
  they are far too impermanent, while stickers are obviously much better;
- reveals that the completed mandatory assignments have already been accruing
  Fledgling Slayer Points even though the system was not explained yet;
- opens the first challenge shop and explains that randomized assignments will
  always be available from this contact for earning more Fledgling Slayer
  Points; and
- introduces the first shop as a source of low-level food and potions. Exact
  stock, quantities, and prices remain a separate economy decision.

This confirms invisible accrual during the first batch: completion dialogue
must reveal the actual balance, not award a second retroactive grant. The
currency's player-facing name is `Fledgling Slayer Points`; internally it
remains the typed `FLEDGLING` challenge balance. Dialogue wording should remain
light and comedic, but the exact post-batch script is not yet locked.

The merged foundation does not match this decision. A later implementation
sync must replace its five Falador tasks/500 kills and humanoid/livestock
families with the nine tasks/307 kills above, define the newly required
families without overlapping NPC IDs, and update the affected totals and
fixtures. No player-visible Monster Slayer state currently makes those
foundation task keys a live compatibility contract.

### Unresolved Opening Details

- Choose the dedicated contact's name, appearance, exact Rising Sun tile, and
  whether the NPC needs ambient dialogue before recruitment. Do not repurpose
  Barmaid `142` or disturb her existing drink, bar-crawl, and holiday behavior.
- Choose the formal quest name, quest-list presentation, journal text, and any
  quest-point treatment. Calling the mandatory path one quest settles its
  lifecycle, but not those presentation details.
- Decide whether the Initiate sticker is dialogue-only rank flavor, a physical
  inventory item, or a displayable cosmetic. If it is an item, tradeability,
  death behavior, duplicate prevention, storage, reclaim, and whether it is
  consumed when displayed all require explicit contracts.
- Set the nine mandatory-task point awards and resulting first revealed balance.
  Retaining the foundation's 25-point Fledgling total is the current
  recommendation, but has not been approved merely by confirming invisible
  accrual.
- Choose the exact low-level food and potion stock, quantities, and Fledgling
  Slayer Point costs. Evaluate each against normal Cooking and Herblaw effort
  before approval.

## Evidence-Backed Combat Odyssey Audit

### Activation And Runtime Owners

MyWorld currently sets `want_combat_odyssey: true` in `server/myworld.conf`.
`World` constructs `CombatOdysseyData` and loads its JSON only when that flag is
enabled. New starts are nevertheless intentionally hidden:
`LegendsQuestSirRadimusErkle.doCombatOdyssey` returns `false` for
`NOT_STARTED`, while partial runs, reward claims, and prestige repeats remain
reachable. This is active compatibility code, not dead code.

The maintained implementation is split across:

- `server/conf/server/defs/extras/CombatOdyssey.json`: tier/task/reward data.
- `server/src/com/openrsc/server/content/minigame/combatodyssey/`: the JSON
  loader and positional `Tier`/`Task` models.
- `server/plugins/com/openrsc/server/plugins/custom/minigames/CombatOdyssey.java`:
  intro, Biggum, active task state, final-blow kill tracking, random task order,
  final reward, prestige, and developer controls.
- Eight authentic quest/NPC dialogue owners plus the Legends ladder, Biggum
  visibility, and player-stat display integrations inventoried below.

Do not delete or switch off those paths until Monster Slayer activation has
migrated live state and supplied replacement dialogue behavior.

### JSON Inventory And Semantics

Repository validation of `CombatOdyssey.json` produced:

| Measure | Result |
| --- | ---: |
| Tiers | 14 (`0` through `13`) |
| Tasks | 101 |
| Required kills | 40,906 |
| Unique referenced NPC IDs | 192 |
| Missing NPC definitions | 0 |
| Maximum tasks in one tier | 20 |
| Referenced unattackable NPC IDs | 2 (`375`, `376`) |
| Referenced IDs with no active MyWorld static spawn | 6 |
| Families with no active static target at all | 0 |

The active tier path is:

| Tier | Master/contact and active location | Tasks | Kills | Reward stored on this tier |
| ---: | --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 0 | General Wartface `151`, Goblin Village `324,447` | 20 | 8,170 | none |
| 1 | General Wartface `151` | 1 | 500 | 20 stat-restoration certs, 200 giant-carp certs, strength amulet, medium rune helmet |
| 2 | Thormac `300`, `511,1452` | 14 | 5,525 | none |
| 3 | Grew `681`, `663,759` | 19 | 7,600 | rune square shield |
| 4 | Dark Mage `667`, `665,567` | 12 | 5,550 | rune battle axe, 20 cure-poison certs |
| 5 | Dark Mage `667` | 1 | 100 | 200 blood runes |
| 6 | Hazelmere `546`, `532,754` | 13 | 5,800 | 200 lava-eel certs, power amulet, rune helmet |
| 7 | Hazelmere `546` | 1 | 500 | 20 poison-antidote certs, rune paladin shield |
| 8 | Sigbert `573`, `584,3575` | 8 | 3,550 | none |
| 9 | Achetties `253`, Heroes Guild `372,443` | 5 | 860 | 100 prayer-potion certs, charged dragonstone amulet, rune two-handed sword |
| 10 | Sir Radimus `785`, Legends Guild `514,535` | 3 | 1,250 | 100 manta-ray certs, 100 sea-turtle certs, dragonstone ring, 20 each super attack/strength/defense certs |
| 11 | Sir Radimus `785` | 2 | 1,000 | none |
| 12 | Sir Radimus `785` | 1 | 500 | none |
| 13 | Sir Radimus `785` | 1 | 1 | none |

Important implementation facts:

- `CombatOdysseyData.load` assigns each task's ID from its array position.
  `getTier(int)` also indexes the tier list instead of looking up `tierId`.
  Reordering either array silently changes persisted meaning.
- `tierId` is loaded into `Tier` but has no getter and is not used as a lookup
  identity. The new system must not inherit this positional contract.
- Every task contains `taskInfoDialog`, but the loader and `Task` discard it.
  Only `monsterInfoDialog` survives.
- A tier's `rewards` are actually granted after the preceding tier completes:
  dialogue first calls `assignNewTier`, then `giveRewards`. Treating the field
  as a completion reward without understanding this order would shift rewards.
- Mandatory tasks within a tier are random, not deterministic. A bit in the
  current tier mask prevents repeats until all tasks in that tier are done.
- The final reward is not in JSON. `CombatOdyssey.radimusDialog` directly gives
  `DRAGON_PLATE_MAIL_LEGS` (`1429`), removes active keys, and then increments
  prestige. That reward path is excluded from Monster Slayer.
- The old intermediate supplies and equipment are balance evidence only. None
  automatically become Monster Slayer shop stock.

This inventory is an audit and migration decoder, not a conversion table. The
new 33-task inventory was selected independently from current definitions,
attackability, spawn availability, travel friction, and the intended contact
themes. Legacy tier boundaries do not define new ranks; legacy random order
does not define mandatory order; and legacy rewards do not define shop tiers,
costs, or stock.

### Legacy Cache And Completion State

Combat Odyssey uses three player-cache keys and an inventory/bank item:

| State | Type | Current meaning and lifecycle |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `combat_odyssey` | String | Overloaded. Missing/`"0"` is not started, `"1"` is Radimus accepted, `"2"` is Biggum met, and `"tier:task:kills"` is an active run. Colon parsing is positional. |
| `co_tier_progress` | Long | Bit mask for completed tasks in only the current tier. It resets on every new tier and is removed after the final reward. |
| `co_prestige` | Integer | Number of final rewards claimed/full Odyssey completions. It is the only durable completed-state marker after active keys are removed. |
| Biggum item `BIGGUM_FLODROT` | item | Companion/tracker may be in inventory or bank. The courtyard NPC `826` at `511,544` is visible only to a prestiged player not carrying/banking the item. |

Consequences for migration:

- `co_prestige > 0` is authoritative proof of at least one claimed completion.
- A valid tier-13 state with its KBD task complete and no prestige is a
  completed-but-unclaimed Odyssey. It must be honored without granting dragon
  armor.
- A tier number proves every lower tier was completed, because tier assignment
  is gated by `isTierCompleted`; the current tier mask plus active kill count
  provides the remaining partial evidence.
- Item possession is not completion evidence and must not be used to infer a
  reward claim.
- The final legacy flow removes active keys before giving the item and only then
  increments prestige. A crash in that window could leave ambiguous state; the
  migration must fail closed rather than infer completion from item ownership.
- `isTierCompleted` uses exact mask equality. Unknown high bits and malformed
  strings should be diagnosed and quarantined, not normalized silently.

The cache already persists typed primitive values through `Cache`,
`GameDatabase.querySavePlayerCache`, and `PlayerService.loadPlayerCache`; no
database schema change is required for Monster Slayer.

### Current Kill Credit

`Npc.killedBy` currently calls the generic `KillNpcTrigger` before
`handleXpDistribution` selects the top-damage owner. `CombatOdyssey.onKillNpc`
therefore receives the player associated with the killing blow (or the owner of
a summon that delivered it), not every contributor and not necessarily the
top-damage player. It increments exactly one player's active count.

Later in the same death path, `Npc` already aggregates melee, ranged, magic,
and summon-owner damage. Its personal-loot path accepts online, living players
with positive damage and applies a contribution scale with a `0.05` floor.
Those maps are private and cleared after XP/drop processing.

Monster Slayer should not change `KillNpcTrigger`, because many quests depend
on its existing final-blow semantics. Its later kill-credit branch should add a
focused contribution snapshot/hook at the NPC-death layer and use this rule:

- Aggregate melee, ranged, magic, and owned-summon damage by player UUID.
- Credit each online, living contributor still within 16 tiles who dealt at
  least `max(1, ceil(npcMaxHits * 0.05))` damage; always credit the top-damage
  contributor when their damage is positive.
- Credit a player at most once per NPC death even if several damage styles or a
  summon contributed.
- Match only the active task's validated family IDs.
- Do not grant points per kill; only advance the bounded active count.

The five-percent recommendation aligns with the existing personal-loot scale
floor while preventing a one-hit tag on larger monsters. It is a Monster
Slayer rule, not authorization to change XP, loot, or existing quest credit.

### Dialogue And Compatibility Integrations

| Current integration | Active Odyssey responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `GoblinDiplomacy` generals | Start tier 0 after Biggum, advance `0 -> 1`, grant tier-1 rewards. |
| `ScorpionCatcher` / Thormac | Advance `1 -> 2`. |
| `WatchTowerDialogues` / Grew | Advance `2 -> 3`, grant tier-3 rewards. |
| `npcs/ardougne/west/DarkMage` | Advance `3 -> 4 -> 5`, grant both entry reward sets. |
| `GrandTree` / Hazelmere | Advance `5 -> 6 -> 7`, require the translation item, grant both entry reward sets. |
| `SigbertTheAdventurer` | Advance `7 -> 8`. |
| `HerosQuest` / Achetties | Advance `8 -> 9`, grant tier-9 rewards. |
| `LegendsQuestSirRadimusErkle` | Hide new starts, recover Biggum, advance `9 -> 10 -> 11 -> 12 -> 13`, grant tier-10 rewards, and claim the final reward. |
| `Ladders` | Automatically introduces/recovers Biggum on the Legends Guild upper-floor ladder. Radimus says to see Siegfried, but no Siegfried Odyssey dialogue starts the tasks. |
| `Npc.isInvisibleTo` | Hides/shows courtyard Biggum from prestige and carried/banked item state. |
| `RegularPlayer` stat display | Shows `co_prestige` as Odyssey completions. |

These integrations are maintained compatibility boundaries until activation.
The Monster Slayer foundation must not edit them. A later cutover branch must
disable legacy advancement as one coordinated change, keep the old keys
readable, and replace rather than stack dialogue routes.

## Target Rank And Contact Design

Stable rank codes are part of the save contract and must never be reordered:

| Code | Rank | Advancement contact |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 0 | Unstamped | Recruit prompt and beer assignment begin the guild quest |
| 1 | Fledgling | Beer completed; first monster assignment available |
| 2 | Initiate | Falador chain complete; Port Sarim available |
| 3 | Veteran | Port Sarim chain complete; Brimhaven available |
| 4 | Elite | Brimhaven chain complete; Champions Guild available |
| 5 | Champion | Champions chain complete; Heroes Guild available |
| 6 | Hero | Heroes chain complete; Legends Guild available |
| 7 | Legend | Legends chain complete; all rank shops available |

The opening contact is a new dedicated NPC. Later-rank candidates are existing,
actively spawned NPCs and need no new placement:

| Contact key | Candidate and exact active location | Existing owner | Integration boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `falador` | New Monster Slayer contact, Rising Sun ground floor; exact ID/tile/name pending | New focused dialogue owner required | Add a dedicated definition and spawn. The contact directs the player to Barmaid `142` for beer; do not replace or intercept the Barmaid's existing dialogue. Update the current foundation contact ID after the new stable NPC ID is approved. |
| `port_sarim` | Bartender `150`, Rusty Anchor `257,626` | `npcs/portsarim/Bartender.java` | Add guild options after quest/bar-crawl priority; do not replace drink service. |
| `brimhaven` | Bartender `279`, Dead Man's Chest `451,705` | `npcs/brimhaven/BrimHavenBartender.java` | Add guild options after bar-crawl/drink behavior. |
| `champions` | Guildmaster `111`, Champions Guild `149,557` | `npcs/varrock/Guildmaster.java` | Preserve Dragon Slayer and normal guild-access dialogue before Monster Slayer options. |
| `heroes` | Achetties `253`, Heroes Guild `372,443` | `quests/members/HerosQuest.java` | Preserve Heroes Quest/cape behavior; remove the old Odyssey tier transition only in the coordinated activation branch. |
| `legends` | Sir Radimus `785`, Legends Guild `514,535` | `LegendsQuestSirRadimusErkle.java` | Use only the guild NPC, not house Radimus `735`; preserve Legends Quest reward/training behavior and replace the hidden Odyssey route during activation. |

Higher contacts require both the previous Monster Slayer rank and their normal
host-guild access. Early conversation should explain which stamp is required
without bypassing Champions, Heroes, or Legends Guild entry requirements.

## Data Design

Create `server/conf/server/defs/extras/MonsterSlayer.json`; do not extend the
positional Odyssey schema. The systems have different identity, ordering,
repeatable, rank, and migration requirements, and extending the old arrays
would make old cache meaning less safe.

Required top-level shape:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "families": [],
  "contacts": [],
  "shops": []
}
```

Family shape:

```json
{
  "key": "goblin",
  "displayName": "Goblins",
  "npcIds": [4, 62, 153, 154, 660]
}
```

Contact/task shape. The `npcId: 142` below records the merged foundation data,
not the newly confirmed final contact; a later player-visible implementation
must replace it with the dedicated NPC's approved stable ID:

```json
{
  "key": "falador",
  "npcId": 142,
  "challenge": "FLEDGLING",
  "requiredRank": "FLEDGLING",
  "awardedRank": "INITIATE",
  "mandatoryTasks": [
    {
      "key": "falador.rats",
      "familyKey": "rat",
      "requiredKills": 100,
      "pointReward": 5
    }
  ],
  "repeatableTasks": [
    {
      "key": "falador.rats.repeatable",
      "familyKey": "rat",
      "requiredKills": 75,
      "pointReward": 5,
      "weight": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

`challenge` is the currency type awarded by every mandatory and repeatable task
owned by that contact. The loader must reject a task-level currency override;
there is only one source of truth for the contact's challenge balance.

Reward/category shape supported by the foundation schema (stock remains empty
until a later approved reward branch):

```json
{
  "key": "legends",
  "challenge": "HERO",
  "categories": [
    {
      "key": "combat_supplies",
      "label": "Combat supplies",
      "iconItemId": 0,
      "rewards": [
        {
          "key": "legends.example_supply",
          "itemId": 0,
          "amount": 1,
          "cost": {
            "FLEDGLING": 5,
            "INITIATE": 3,
            "HERO": 1
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The example cost means five Fledgling points, three Initiate points, and one
Hero point per reward unit. It does not mean nine interchangeable points. Cost
vectors omit zero entries and are multiplied component-by-component for a
requested quantity using checked `long` arithmetic.

Stable identity rules:

- Persist task/contact/family keys, never JSON array positions or display text.
- Keys are lowercase ASCII dot-separated identifiers and are immutable once
  published. Display text may change without migration.
- A family owns NPC membership. Multiple contacts may reference the same family
  key; do not duplicate its ID list.
- Challenge codes are `FLEDGLING`, `INITIATE`, `VETERAN`, `ELITE`, `CHAMPION`,
  and `HERO`. There is no global or `LEGEND` point balance: the Legends contact
  awards and spends Hero points.
- Mandatory array order is authored progression order, but an active save stores
  the stable task key. Reordering future display data cannot retarget a player.
- Dialogue remains in the contact plugin/service, with optional dialogue keys
  in data only after a localization contract exists. Do not copy the unused
  `taskInfoDialog` field.

Load-time/CI validation must reject:

- unknown/duplicate keys, rank codes, contact NPC IDs, family NPC IDs, or task
  references;
- nonattackable targets or a family with no active MyWorld static spawn;
- duplicate NPC IDs across different families (reuse one family instead);
- zero/negative kills, points, weights, or counts beyond configured safe caps;
- a mandatory chain whose required/awarded ranks do not form the exact ladder;
- duplicate mandatory/repeatable task keys or empty task pools;
- any material/certificate turn-in field or any finished dragon-equipment item
  reward field;
- an unknown/duplicate shop, category, or reward key, unknown item ID,
  nonpositive item amount, empty/negative/overflowing cost vector, or cost in a
  challenge above the shop's challenge tier;
- a launch reward with no positive native-currency cost. Higher-tier launch
  rewards may additionally require any selected lower-tier balances.

### Current Foundation Family Inventory And Tuning

The table in this subsection records the merged foundation baseline. Its five
Falador rows, five Falador repeatables, and aggregate totals are superseded by
the confirmed Fledgling design above and require a later implementation sync.
The remaining rows are still informed starting points, not immutable decisions.

Spawn counts below are active location records for the current MyWorld load set:
base `NpcLocs.json`, enabled discontinued/mod-room/runecraft/auction/harvesting/
custom-quest/other files, `MyWorldNpcLocs.json`, tutorial cleanup, and explicit
MyWorld removals. They are validation evidence, not a promise that every spawn
is equally accessible. All listed IDs resolve, are attackable, and have at least
one active static spawn.

Merged foundation totals, retained as synchronization evidence:

| Band/challenge currency | Mandatory tasks | Mandatory kills | Native currency awarded | Random repeatable pool |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Fledgling -> Initiate | 5 | 500 | 25 | 5 |
| Initiate -> Veteran | 5 | 600 | 40 | 5 |
| Veteran -> Elite | 5 | 850 | 60 | 5 |
| Elite -> Champion | 5 | 1,100 | 90 | 5 |
| Champion -> Hero | 6 | 850 | 150 | 6 |
| Hero -> Legend | 7 | 1,126 | 260 | 6; KBD remains a capstone only |
| **Vector total** | **33** | **5,026** | **Fledgling 25; Initiate 40; Veteran 60; Elite 90; Champion 150; Hero 260** | **32** |

This cuts the mandatory wall to about 12 percent of the old 40,906 kills while
keeping a substantial rank path. The six values form a balance vector, not a
625-point pool. Supply redemption and optional expensive rewards can extend the
lifetime hunt through repeatables without delaying shop access.

If every later band remains unchanged, the confirmed Fledgling replacement
changes the target mandatory inventory from 33 tasks/5,026 kills to 37
tasks/4,833 kills. The overall point vector and repeatable count cannot be
restated as settled totals until the nine Fledgling point awards and new
Fledgling randomized pool are approved.

Repeatable policy:

- Equal weight `1` at launch; family-specific counts in the table already
  account for density and difficulty.
- Assignment uses the contact whose mandatory chain is complete. A player may
  use any completed contact, regardless of higher rank.
- Cancelling an accepted repeatable costs half its native challenge reward
  rounded up from that same balance:
  Falador `3`, Port Sarim `4`, Brimhaven `6`, Champions `9`, Heroes `13`,
  Legends `18`. No negative balance and no free replacement if payment fails.
- Task blocks, free rerolls, streak bonuses, and boss randomization are deferred
  until their shop rewards are explicitly approved.

Legacy IDs intentionally excluded from the launch inventory include unspawned
variants (`473`, `583`, `694`, `50`, `359`, `710`), unattackable guards (`375`,
`376`), civilians/quest personalities, and misleading family additions such as
Firebird `252`, Wormbrain `192`, Greldo `109`, Melzar `182`, Gunthor `78`,
Salarin `567`, Colonel Radick `518`, named bandit leaders, Ogre citizen `704`,
Blessed Vermen `630`, target-practice zombies, and happy peasants. They remain
valid historical Odyssey targets but are unsafe defaults for the new guild.

## Player State Design

Use existing typed player-cache storage through one `MonsterSlayerState` owner.
Dialogue and kill handlers must not manipulate raw keys.

| Key | Type | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `monster_slayer_state_version` | Integer | Current state schema; starts at `1`. |
| `monster_slayer_intro_stage` | Integer | `0` not started, `1` beer requested, `2` beer completed. Stage 2 requires rank at least Fledgling. |
| `monster_slayer_rank` | Integer | Stable rank code `0..7`; never a display/string ordinal. |
| `monster_slayer_balance_<challenge>` | Long | Six keys: `fledgling`, `initiate`, `veteran`, `elite`, `champion`, and `hero`. Each is independently nonnegative with checked additions/deductions and a `2,000,000,000` cap. No scalar total is persisted or spendable. |
| `monster_slayer_active_task` | String | Stable task key; absent means no task. Contact/family/type derive from definitions. |
| `monster_slayer_active_kills` | Integer | Bounded `0..requiredKills`; absent/zero when no active task. |
| `monster_slayer_mandatory_<contact>` | Integer | Six keys storing the number of fixed tasks completed for that contact, bounded by that chain's data length. |
| `monster_slayer_tasks_completed` | Long | Lifetime mandatory plus repeatable completion statistic; no rank authority. |
| `monster_slayer_migration_version` | Integer | One-time Odyssey migration marker; version `1` for the rules below. |
| `monster_slayer_legacy_status` | Integer | `0` none, `1` partial, `2` completed-unclaimed, `3` completed-claimed. Preserves future commemorative eligibility. |
| `monster_slayer_legacy_prestige` | Integer | Nonnegative snapshot of `co_prestige`; historical statistic only. |

Invariants:

- Rank is monotonic. Point spending cannot lower rank.
- `MonsterSlayerChallenge` has the explicit stable order Fledgling through Hero;
  enum ordinal is not persistence or authorization. `MonsterSlayerBalances`
  exposes typed access and never treats the vector sum as currency.
- A rank requires every lower contact cursor to equal its chain length.
- The active mandatory task must be exactly the current contact cursor's stable
  key. A repeatable task requires that contact cursor to be complete.
- Missing active-task definitions, out-of-range cursors, negative values, or
  rank/cursor contradictions produce a bounded diagnostic and no mutation.
- Task completion updates progress, cursor/rank, points, lifetime count, and
  active-task clearing through one state-owner method on the game thread.
- Task completion credits only the active definition's contact challenge. It
  cannot credit a caller-selected or higher balance.
- Multi-cost spending first validates the reward/shop tier, quantity, checked
  component multiplication, and all six available balances against an
  immutable snapshot. It computes the complete post-spend vector before
  writing any balance. Insufficient currency changes nothing.
- A successful deduction returns the exact typed cost vector as a one-use
  receipt. A later item-grant failure refunds every receipt component; callers
  cannot refund a caller-constructed or already-refunded vector.
- Completion is derived from `rank == LEGEND` and all six mandatory cursors;
  do not add a redundant completion boolean.
- Do not create `monster_slayer_prestige` in version 1. Old `co_prestige` counts
  full 40,906-kill Odyssey completions and is not equivalent to repeating the
  new rank path. A future prestige contract needs its own approved loop first.

## Safe Combat Odyssey Migration

Migration is lazy for accounts with legacy evidence and idempotent through
`monster_slayer_migration_version`. The foundation branch implements and tests
the pure conversion but does not invoke it on live players. The later activation
branch invokes it before Monster Slayer dialogue or kill credit can mutate new
state.

Never delete or rewrite `combat_odyssey`, `co_tier_progress`, or `co_prestige`.
They remain recovery evidence. Do not remove Biggum from inventory/bank in the
migration transaction.

### Classification

1. If migration version is already `1`, return without awarding anything.
2. If `co_prestige > 0`, classify `completed-claimed`, grant `Legend`, complete
   all mandatory cursors, and preserve the prestige count.
3. Otherwise, if a valid tier-13 active record has its sole KBD task marked or
   has a bounded kill count of at least one, classify `completed-unclaimed`,
   grant `Legend`, and complete all mandatory cursors.
4. Otherwise, a valid intro stage `1`/`2` or active colon record is `partial`.
5. Missing/zero intro state with no other evidence is `none`; initialize normal
   defaults without legacy credit.
6. Wrong cache types, malformed strings, unknown tier/task IDs, negative kills,
   impossible masks, or rank contradictions are quarantined. Log the key names
   and validation reason, not a whole cache dump; make no migration award and
   do not set the migration version until repaired.

### Rank And Chain Recognition

Do not map legacy tier ranges onto new ranks or task cursors. That would make
the independently authored ladder a disguised Odyssey translation.

| Legacy evidence | New rank | New chains marked complete |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Intro stage `1`/`2` or any valid partial active run | Fledgling | none |
| Completed-unclaimed or `co_prestige > 0` | Legend | all six |

A partial player receives bounded challenge balances for aggregate effort but
starts the new mandatory path at Falador. A completed player receives full
rank recognition because completion itself is the legacy accomplishment; the
old sequence and rewards are not recreated.

### Bounded Challenge-Balance Vector

Compute aggregate legacy credited kills only as migration evidence:

1. Sum every task's required kills in tiers below the active legacy tier.
2. In the active tier, sum required kills for valid completed mask bits.
3. If the current task's bit is not complete, add its active kill count clamped
   to `0..requiredKills`. Do not count a completed current task twice.
4. Clamp the result to the Odyssey total `40,906` and calculate one overall
   completion ratio. Do not expose tier/task identities to new progression.

The base full-completion migration vector is deliberately bounded at twice the
new mandatory-path earnings:

| Challenge balance | Mandatory-path earnings | Full legacy base credit |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Fledgling | 25 | 50 |
| Initiate | 40 | 80 |
| Veteran | 60 | 120 |
| Elite | 90 | 180 |
| Champion | 150 | 300 |
| Hero | 260 | 520 |

For a partial, noncompleted Odyssey, each component is:

`floor(creditedKills * fullLegacyBase[challenge] / 40,906)`.

For completed-unclaimed, award the exact full base vector. For claimed
completion, begin with that vector and add, per component, one quarter of the
base for each additional `co_prestige` completion. Count at most twelve extra
completions, so no component can exceed four times its full base. If a claimed
player also has a valid active repeat Odyssey, add one quarter of that repeat's
partial vector before applying the same four-times-base component caps.

All multiplication/division uses checked `long` arithmetic and floors only at
the final component calculation. The proposal is one immutable six-component
vector; it is not summed, normalized, exchanged, or shifted between challenge
types.

The conversion records no new active task. It never grants old intermediate
items, a final dragon item, material credit, a recreated Odyssey reward, or a
new prestige count.

### Cutover Rules

The later activation branch must be atomic in behavior even if delivered as a
focused commit:

- migrate before the first new dialogue/kill mutation;
- stop legacy kill advancement and tier assignment for migrated players;
- keep legacy keys/stat display readable and keep Biggum personality content;
- remove the hidden Radimus start/reward role only when the new Legends contact
  can serve migrated players;
- prevent both systems from crediting the same death;
- provide a staff inspection command/report before any repair command;
- back up the player database and test migration on a copy before live use.

## Challenge Shops And Rangers Guild Redemption Model

`RangersGuildPointsVendor` is the interaction and failure-handling reference,
not a reusable scalar-currency implementation. Its maintained flow is:

1. Show authored categories.
2. Let the player select an item within a category and a quantity.
3. Multiply cost and output with overflow checks.
4. Verify the scalar Rangers Guild balance.
5. Verify inventory capacity before spending.
6. Deduct points, grant the item, and refund points if the add unexpectedly
   fails.

Monster Slayer should preserve that order and user experience while replacing
the scalar assumptions:

- Categories should primarily organize useful combat supplies obtainable by
  normal skilling: weapons, armor, potions, food, ammunition, and related
  combat preparation. `Unique/Prestige` and `Task Utility` may be additional
  categories; shops are not restricted to unique items.
- Item definitions remain normal item definitions. The challenge-shop data
  supplies category, output amount, shop tier, and a typed cost vector.
- Quantity multiplies every cost component and output amount using checked
  arithmetic. Affordability requires every component, not the vector sum.
- A reward at tier `T` may require its native `T` balance and any selected
  lower-tier balances. It must never reference a challenge currency higher
  than `T`. Launch rewards require a positive native component.
- Capacity is checked before deduction. Deduction validates and applies the
  whole vector atomically. If item grant fails, refund the exact one-use receipt
  vector before reporting failure.
- No balance exchange, automatic conversion, overpayment from a higher balance,
  or fallback to a lower balance is allowed.

The current production interface cannot represent this faithfully:
`ProductionSession` carries one scalar point value and each `ProductionRecipe`
has one scalar cost/enabled flag. Monster Slayer therefore needs either a
multi-cost reward display or a confirmation step that lists every required
balance and the player's corresponding balances. Do not put a summed number in
the existing scalar field or pretend the challenge currencies are
interchangeable. Redemption UI and protocol/presentation changes are explicitly
outside the foundation branch.

The old Odyssey rewards are neither default stock nor price anchors. Existing
combat supplies may be selected from current item definitions in a later stock
audit, but their skilling acquisition, market value, tradeability, certificate/
stack behavior, and output quantity must be reviewed before a cost vector is
authored.

### Explicit Owner Decisions For Unique Rewards

Useful supply stock does not require every unique decision to be resolved, but
the following choices are required before adding the affected unique:

| Decision | Recommended default | Why it is required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Giant's Axe | If approved, place a new slow two-handed sidegrade in the Champion challenge shop; owner must choose stats, requirements, special behavior, tradeability, art, output amount, and its full cost vector. | No such current item or authoritative stat/cost line exists. |
| Legends chase reward | Choose the archetype first: weapon, non-armor accessory, reusable contract utility, or prestige cosmetic. Recommended: a monster-hunting utility/accessory, not armor. | Its combat value determines native Hero and lower-tier costs. |
| Legacy completion recognition | Give claimed and completed-unclaimed Odyssey players the same noncombat commemorative entitlement; decide title versus cosmetic item. | Migration preserves an entitlement class but must not improvise a reward. |
| Unique reclaim model | Decide tradeability, death behavior, duplicate ownership, and lost-item reclaim separately for each unique. | These are economy and duplication contracts, not UI details. |
| Convenience unlocks | Decide whether paid rerolls/task blocks become rewards or only the direct cancellation fee remains. Recommended launch: cancellation fee only. | Permanent blocks materially change assignment probability and state. |
| Unique cost vectors | Approve every required component and quantity. Recommended: positive native currency plus deliberately selected lower currencies, never all six by habit. | A scalar price band cannot express challenge-specific effort. |

Hard exclusions requiring no further decision: dragon armor and dragon skirts
are not rewards; material/certificate turn-ins are not progression; old item
rewards are not automatically shop stock; and challenge balances are never
exchangeable.

## Current Bounded Foundation Branch

Branch: `feat/monster-slayer-data-state-foundation`.

Implementation status: complete within the boundary below. The branch loads
and validates definitions during MyWorld startup, but no player state is read,
written, or migrated by runtime gameplay. Its state and migration APIs remain
pure/uninvoked foundations for later activation branches.

Scope:

- Add `MonsterSlayer.json` with schema version 1, the stable rank/contact/
  family/task keys, exact mandatory/repeatable counts, challenge ownership, and
  native point values above. The shop array remains empty in committed launch
  data until stock is separately approved.
- Add focused immutable definition types and `MonsterSlayerData` loader/
  validator. Load/validate the data in server startup, but expose no player
  dialogue, task assignment, kill credit, redemption, or reward behavior.
- Add `MonsterSlayerRank` with explicit numeric codes and parsing that does not
  depend on enum ordinal.
- Add `MonsterSlayerChallenge`, immutable six-component balances/costs, reward
  schema types, tier/cost validation, checked quantity multiplication, atomic
  affordability/deduction proposals, and exact one-use refund receipts. These
  are foundation APIs and compiled fixtures, not a redemption UI or live shop.
- Add `MonsterSlayerState` as the only raw-cache-key owner, including default,
  six typed balance keys, validation, bounded arithmetic, active-task
  invariants, and an in-memory snapshot/write API. Do not wire new state
  mutation into login or gameplay.
- Add a pure `CombatOdysseyMigration` converter implementing the rules above.
  It accepts a legacy snapshot plus validated Odyssey/Monster Slayer data and
  returns either a proposed rank/cursor/challenge-balance snapshot or a typed
  validation failure. It does not write a player cache in this branch.
- Document the old data/integration classes as compatibility sources. Do not
  edit their runtime behavior, the eight dialogue integrations, `Npc.killedBy`,
  rewards, items, configs, databases, or the public server.

Tests:

- JSON/schema fixture: unique stable keys, exact rank ladder, exact 33 mandatory
  tasks/5,026 kills, challenge vector `25/40/60/90/150/260`, 32 repeatables,
  positive bounds, resolvable and attackable NPC IDs, active spawn evidence,
  and no unsafe excluded IDs.
- Exclusion fixture: no material/certificate field, finished dragon-equipment
  ID, retired skirt, committed shop stock, or positional persisted task
  identity.
- Compiled data fixture: load the real JSON; resolve keys independent of array
  order; reject duplicates, missing families, bad ranks, nonattackable IDs,
  zero-spawn families, invalid counts, broken contact chains, task/contact
  challenge mismatches, unknown reward components, and costs above shop tier.
- Compiled vector-cost fixture: the `5 Fledgling / 3 Initiate / 1 Hero`
  example, quantity multiplication/overflow, all-component affordability,
  no-partial deduction, exact refund, double-refund rejection, balance caps,
  no scalar sum spending, and each shop-tier boundary.
- Compiled state fixture: defaults, every rank code, cursor/rank consistency,
  active mandatory/repeatable validation, each typed balance, multi-cost
  add/spend/refund bounds, completion derivation, cache round trip, missing
  keys, wrong types, and corrupt values. Assert the old scalar cache key is
  neither read nor written.
- Compiled migration fixture: no-state, intro stages, every tier boundary,
  partial current task, completed current-task bit without double count,
  malformed masks/strings/types, completed-unclaimed KBD, claimed completion,
  active prestige repeat, all six proportional components, per-component caps,
  no partial rank/cursor translation, legacy-key preservation, and repeated
  migration idempotence.
- Run the existing dragon-production/removal guard, NPC location cleanup test,
  full server build, plugin build (even though plugins should be unchanged),
  and changed-code static analysis.

Stop conditions:

- Stop if the foundation needs player-visible dialogue, login mutation, kill
  hooks, actual shop stock/items, redemption UI/protocol changes, reward
  balance, database schema changes, or edits to Combat Odyssey compatibility
  behavior.
- Stop on any need to infer completion from inventory, silently repair malformed
  legacy state, reuse positional IDs, or include material/dragon rewards.
- Hand off the tested data/state/vector-cost/migration foundation before
  starting the Falador introduction, redemption UI/stock, or
  contribution-aware kill-credit branch.
