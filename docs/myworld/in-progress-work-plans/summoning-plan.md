# MyWorld Summoning Plan

This document is the source of truth for the current Summoning implementation
and the next tuning pass.

It is now scoped around the first full summon book: a small level 1-70
catalog, a real Summoning skill, and the already-proven combat/support/utility
runtime.

## Goals

- Maintain a real summoning system instead of one-off scripted companions.
- Keep `Wolf` and `Hellhound` leather set bonuses on the summon runtime.
- Support combat, support, and resolving utility summons.
- Keep the first 12-summon catalog spaced from level `1` through level `70`.

## Core Rules

- A summon consumes runes and raw materials.
- Every summon requires the hidden `Life rune`.
- Most creature-based combat and support summons require bones equivalent to the
  creature. Utility summons do not require bones.
- Additional rune costs follow these intended rules:
  - `Body runes` are used for weaker/basic summons.
  - Elemental runes are used when the creature has a matching element.
  - `Nature runes` are used for medium creature summons.
  - `Law runes` are used for utility summons.
  - `Soul runes` are used for high-end summons.
  - Other runes may be mixed in when thematically appropriate.
- Summons may also require physical materials such as hides or other
  creature-themed inputs.
- Only `one` summon may be active per player per source.
- Normal/manual summoning and armor-effect summoning are separate sources, so
  armor summons can coexist with a normal summon if the system supports it.
- Manual summoning has a `5 second` charge time.
- The charge is interrupted if the player takes damage before it completes.
- Resource costs are consumed only after the charge completes successfully.

## Skill Progression

The first 13 summons are ordered below and should be evenly spaced across
levels `1-70`.

| Level | Summon | Role | Cast XP |
| ---: | --- | --- | ---: |
| 1 | Broodling Spider | Combat, melee | 15 |
| 7 | Mischief Imp | Support | 30 |
| 12 | Loot Goblin | Support | 45 |
| 14 | Ironhide Bear | Combat, melee | 55 |
| 20 | Sacred Unicorn | Support | 80 |
| 26 | Duskwind Bat | Combat, ranged | 110 |
| 33 | Pack Rat | Utility | 145 |
| 39 | Bound Battleaxe | Combat, melee | 185 |
| 45 | Mourning Unicorn | Support | 230 |
| 51 | Restless Shade | Combat, ranged plus fear | 280 |
| 58 | Delivery Camel | Utility | 335 |
| 64 | Astral Wraith | Combat, magic | 395 |
| 70 | Abyssal Demon | Combat, melee or magic | 460 |

The exact levels can be tuned, but this should remain the baseline progression
until a larger summon catalog exists.

Cast XP is awarded only after a summon charge completes successfully and costs
are consumed.

## Naming Direction

Summons use distinct player-facing names rather than directly copying their NPC
source names. `Pack Rat` is the model: it still uses a rat NPC source visually
and mechanically, but the summon reads as its own ability.

Summon icon files live in `dev/myworld/assets/sprites/UI/summon` and are named
from the summon display name in lowercase with spaces converted to dashes:
`broodling-spider.png`, `mischief-imp.png`, `loot-goblin.png`,
`ironhide-bear.png`, `sacred-unicorn.png`, `duskwind-bat.png`, `pack-rat.png`,
`bound-battleaxe.png`, `mourning-unicorn.png`, `restless-shade.png`,
`delivery-camel.png`, `astral-wraith.png`, and `abyssal-demon.png`.

## Summon Roles

### Attacker

- Higher damage.
- Lower health.
- Assists the player in combat against the player's current target.

### Tank

- Lower damage.
- Higher health.
- Protects the player either by taking aggro or by absorbing/transferring
  damage that would otherwise hit the player.
- Damage transfer is the preferred first implementation because it is less
  likely to disrupt existing multi-attacker combat.

### Support

- Does not attack.
- Does not take damage.
- Provides passive player effects.
- Lasts `1 minute`.
- If the player has `Life runes`, consumes `1 Life rune` each minute instead
  of despawning.
- Despawns when dismissed, replaced, or the owner logs out/dies.

### Utility

- Does not attack.
- Does not take damage.
- Appears to perform a non-combat action, then despawns.
- Intended utility actions include:
  - selecting an inventory item and converting all matching inventory items to
    notes
  - depositing a limited number of selected inventory items into the bank
- If the utility cannot resolve, it should despawn after `1 minute`.

## Summon Lifetime Rules

### Combat Summons

- Combat summons persist until they die, are replaced, or their owner logs
  out/dies.
- Armor-based combat summons can die and then enter a cooldown before returning.
- They should despawn cleanly when:
  - the player logs out
  - the player dies
  - the summon dies
  - the summon is replaced by a new summon

### Utility Summons

- Utility summons remain until their utility resolves.
- If they cannot complete their utility, they should despawn after `1 minute`
  to avoid lingering.
- They should also despawn on logout or replacement.

## Completed Proof Targets

The first proof implementation has already established the core summon runtime.

### Combat Proof Summon

- `Bear`
  - behavior:
    - summons a bear companion
    - the bear attacks whatever the player attacks
    - enemies do not target the bear directly
    - the bear absorbs part of enemy damage dealt to its owner
    - summoned-bear stats are defined by the summon profile, not by editing the
      base bear NPC
    - persists until it dies, is replaced, or its owner logs out/dies

### Utility Proof Summon

- `Rat`
  - cost:
    - `1 Life rune`
    - `2 Body runes`
    - `1 bones`
  - behavior:
    - summons a rat companion
    - interacting with the rat asks the player to select an inventory item
    - the rat converts all matching unnoted inventory items into notes
    - the rat then despawns
  - fallback:
    - if the rat cannot complete its utility, it despawns after `1 minute`

## Current Implementation Status

- The summon tab contains the first 12-summon catalog in the planned order.
- Server casts are driven by shared summon profiles instead of one-off test
  entries.
- Resource costs are enforced for the first 12 summons.
- Summoning has a `5 second` charge.
- Taking damage during the charge interrupts the summon.
- Costs are consumed after a successful charge, not when the summon is clicked.
- Successful casts award Summoning XP after costs are consumed.
- The on-player summoning animation starts when the charge starts, lasts for the
  charge window, and is cleared early if the charge is interrupted.
- Successful summons play a role-specific arrival animation at the summon
  location. Combat and support summons reveal on the `6th` frame; utility
  summons reveal on the `4th` frame.
- Combat summon health and max hit scale from Summoning level, using each
  summon profile's base values and growth intervals.
- Support and utility summons do not absorb damage.
- Support summons last `1 minute` and begin at `1 Life rune` per minute to
  stay active. Their upkeep rises by `1 Life rune` every `3 minutes` active,
  then recovers by `1 Life rune` for each `1 minute` without a support summon.
- Utility summons time out after `1 minute`.
- `Summoning` is a persisted MyWorld skill with database columns, stat packet
  fields, and client stat array support.
- The first 12 summons are level-gated by Summoning level.
- `Mischief Imp` blocks hostile NPC aggro while active and despawns when the player
  starts attacking.
- `Mourning Unicorn` auto-buries prayer drops, including bones, bat bones, big
  bones, dragon bones, generic ashes, and demon ash, for double prayer XP.
- Ranged and magic combat summons use projectile attacks with owner kill/XP
  credit preserved.
- `Abyssal Demon` uses a mixed melee/magic attack pattern.

## Existing Codebase Support

The current codebase already has useful pieces:

- hidden summon-related spell entries in
  `server/src/com/openrsc/server/constants/Spells.java`
- timed NPC spawning helpers in
  `server/src/com/openrsc/server/plugins/Functions.java`
- NPC chase behavior in
  `server/src/com/openrsc/server/model/entity/npc/Npc.java`
- owner-linked kill credit through `relatedMob` in
  `server/src/com/openrsc/server/model/entity/npc/Npc.java`
- existing pet-oriented config and temporary-NPC patterns

These are enough to build a first proper system. They are not enough to skip
system design.

## Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Summon Framework

Build a shared summon framework rather than special-casing each summon.

Required pieces:

- a `SummonDefinition` model:
  - summon id
  - summon role (`attacker`, `tank`, `support`, or `utility`)
  - summon source (`manual`, `armor`, or future source)
  - rune costs
  - item/material costs
  - duration or resolution rule
  - spawned NPC id
- player summon state:
  - active summon id per source
  - active summon NPC reference per source when a visible NPC exists
  - summon expiry or cooldown per source
- single-active-summon enforcement per source
- shared summon spawn/despawn helpers
- cleanup on:
  - logout
  - player death
  - summon death
  - replacement
  - timeout

## Phase 2: Combat Summon Behavior

Implement the first combat companion behavior using `Bear`.

Required pieces:

- owner linkage from summon NPC to player
- summon-specific profiles:
  - base NPC id and visual
  - summon role and source
  - duration
  - custom attack, defense, ranged, strength, and hits values
  - optional damage cap
  - optional owner-damage absorption percent
- target mirroring:
  - if the player attacks a target, the summon should assist that same target
- assist rules:
  - enemies should not target summons directly
  - tank summons should absorb a portion of damage dealt to their owner instead
    of becoming enemy targets
  - summon should not create combat lock issues
  - summon should not break current multi-attacker combat behavior
- reward rules:
  - summon damage should still resolve kill credit and loot ownership properly
  - player ownership should remain explicit

## Phase 3: Utility Summon Behavior

Implement the first utility summon using `Rat`.

Required pieces:

- summon interaction trigger
- inventory item-selection prompt
- note conversion for all matching unnoted inventory items
- validation rules:
  - item exists in inventory
  - item can be noted
  - inventory items are removed before notes are created
- success despawn
- failure timeout despawn after `1 minute`

## Phase 4: Content Entry Path

Summoning is cast from the third subtab in the existing magic/prayer side
panel.

Current UI direction:

- keep the `Magic`, `Prayer`, and `Summon` subtabs in the same panel
- display summons in the same icon-grid style as spells and prayers
- show summon level, cost, and role/effect in the tooltip area
- send summon casts through a custom interface packet, not through dev commands

Remaining work after limited release:

- field-test full catalog behavior and tune numbers/effects from observed play
- supply original summon icons if icon art is restored; the current
  charge/arrival animation assets are wired

Implemented work:

- replaced the temporary four-entry hardcoded client list with the first
  12-summon catalog
- added the persisted `Summoning` skill
- enforce summon level requirements
- enforce resource requirements server-side
- start a `5 second` interruptible charge before costs are consumed and the
  summon appears
- consume resources only after the charge succeeds
- award Summoning XP only on successful casts
- implemented Imp enemy safety
- implemented Black Unicorn auto-bury
- implemented Ghost fear
- implemented ranged/magic summon projectile styles
- implemented Greater Demon mixed melee/magic attacks

## Phase 5: Wolf And Hellhound Integration

Implemented as armor-bound spirit companions:

- full `Wolf` set summons a `Spirit Wolf Companion`
  - invulnerable
  - no resource cost
  - does not absorb damage
  - attacks the player's current target for up to `3` damage
- full `Hellhound` set summons a `Spirit Hellhound Companion`
  - invulnerable
  - no resource cost
  - does not absorb damage
  - attacks the player's current target for up to `6` damage
  - has a `5%` chance per attack to proc `Hell's Fire`

These armor companions use a separate summon slot from manual Summoning skill
summons. They appear when all `5` matching pieces are equipped and fade when
the set is broken.

## Technical Guardrails

- Do not implement summon behavior as scattered special-case NPC scripts.
- Do not let summons bypass the shared combat ownership model.
- Do not allow multiple active manual summons per player.
- Armor-bound spirit companions may coexist with one manual summon because
  their source is equipment rather than a cast.
- Do not leave summoned NPCs stranded on logout or failed utility resolution.
- Keep new summon additions narrow and testable; avoid adding broad summon
  content before the first catalog has enough field-test data.

## Open Design Decisions

These remain tuning/design questions after the first catalog implementation:

- utility summons beyond Pack Rat and Camel
- whether combat summons should follow the player when out of combat
- how much direct control the player has over a summon
- the exact chance for `Fear` to negate an enemy attack
- whether Greater Demon alternates attacks randomly or follows a fixed melee /
  magic pattern

## Recommended Next Order

1. Field-test each summon in level order, checking cost consumption, XP, effect,
   dismissal, replacement, and logout cleanup.
2. Tune summon cost, XP, damage, hits, and traits based on field-test results.
3. Add further visual variants only when an identified presentation need
   justifies them.
