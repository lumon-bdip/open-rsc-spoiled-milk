# Project Structure Refactor Plan

Plan status: **active; Phase 0 guardrails and code-health B01-B11 reconciled on
2026-07-16** against published `main` commit `ecfc3b35d`.

This is the AI-facing plan for rebuilding Spoiled Milk's folder and package
structure safely. The project is inherited from OpenRSC, which inherited from
older RuneScape Classic code. The goal is not cosmetic cleanup. The goal is to
make the codebase easier to reason about while preserving the live game.

Use this plan together with
[`code-cleanup-and-modularization-plan.md`](code-cleanup-and-modularization-plan.md).
The cleanup plan lists oversized files and extraction targets. This file defines
the workspace safety rules and the intended ownership layout.

## Current Refactor Scope

The project/workflow safety refactor created after branch and launch confusion
is now established and remains a non-negotiable contract. The completed B01-B11
code-health sequence then added build/static-analysis foundations and extracted
the first renderer, packet, definition, equipment, and spell ownership
boundaries. The active structure work can now continue with narrow
behavior-preserving `mudclient` ownership extractions; this is not authority for
a mass package or folder move.

Current priority order:

1. Preserve the completed hosted/private launch and physical-worktree
   guardrails; never weaken them for refactor convenience.
2. Complete `RendererSettingsPanel`, `RendererProfileApplier`,
   `LegacySoftwareScalingSettings`, `ClientExternalAssetLoader`, and
   `ClientSceneInstanceStore` in that order.
3. Reconcile the resulting dependency/facade map before choosing any further
   `mudclient`, presenter, world, graphics, or telemetry extraction.
4. Move packages only after those owners are stable and a package move can be
   mechanical.
5. Defer `Client_Base`/`PC_Client` top-level renames until ownership extraction
   and package boundaries are complete and build/release impact is separately
   approved.

The cleanup plan contains the executable branch contracts, tests, private
visual checks, and stop conditions for this active sequence. This plan defines
when those owners may later move.

## Safety Contract

The live hosted server must never depend on the active development worktree.

- Manager worktree: `main` only, used to collect, test, publish, and release.
- AI worker worktrees: neutral numbered folders, each owning one temporary
  focused topic branch at a time.
- Live worktree: clean detached `HEAD` at an exact published-main commit;
  never used for development.
- Dirty worktrees are acceptable for development, but unsafe for public hosted
  server startup.
- If a command starts the hosted server, it must be obvious which worktree,
  branch, commit, database, and item definitions it is using.

If these rules conflict with convenience, the safety rules win.

## Working Folders

Use physical folders so branch state is visible from the path.

| Folder | Branch | Purpose | Live server allowed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/tmp/spoiled-milk-live-main` | detached published commit | Clean live-server deployment. | Yes |
| `/home/justin/Core-Framework` | `main` | Manager: review, merge, test, publish, release, and deploy. | No |
| `/home/justin/Core-Framework-ai-1` | temporary topic branch or detached IDLE | Neutral AI worker slot. | No |
| `/home/justin/Core-Framework-ai-2` | temporary topic branch or detached IDLE | Neutral AI worker slot. | No |
| `/home/justin/Core-Framework-ai-3` | temporary topic branch or detached IDLE | Neutral AI worker slot. | No |

The numbered folders describe AI seats, not categories of work. Feature,
bugfix, plan, and structural tasks all receive short-lived descriptive
branches in whichever slot is free.

Recommended setup:

```bash
./scripts/ai-workspace.sh init 3
./scripts/ai-workspace.sh start ai-1 refactor/project-structure
./scripts/ai-manager.sh status
```

Before any hosted release or server restart, confirm the live checkout is
clean, detached, published-main history, and not a feature/refactor branch.

## Refactor Branch Rules

- One ownership area per commit where practical.
- Compile after every extraction.
- Keep moved code behavior-identical in the first pass.
- Do not rename and rewrite in the same pass unless the old shape makes a safe
  move impossible.
- Do not delete compatibility paths until their callers, launchers, configs,
  generated data, and docs have been checked.
- Do not expose hidden legacy options as player-facing settings while moving
  code.
- Avoid touching live server scripts from the structure branch unless the task
  is specifically about launch safety.
- If launch safety scripts are changed, test them from a clean main-derived
  branch before merging.

## Current Top-Level Reality

These roots are active today:

| Current path | Current role |
| --- | --- |
| `Client_Base/` | Shared client code, game UI, legacy graphics, client definitions, settings, world/scene logic. |
| `PC_Client/` | Desktop/LWJGL launcher and OpenGL presenter. |
| `server/` | Server runtime, definitions, plugins, persistence, commands, combat, world state. |
| `tools/generators/` | Source-of-truth generators for item/NPC/data definitions. |
| `scripts/` | Build, launch, package, release, and utility wrappers. |
| `tests/myworld/` | MyWorld validation tests. |
| `docs/myworld/` | Active plans, completed records, stable references, and screenshots. |
| `dev/myworld/` | Compatibility wrappers and active visual asset source. Do not add new planning docs here. |
| `docs/inherited-openrsc/` | Archived inherited OpenRSC/Cabbage reference material. |

## Completed Foundations Through B11

The structure plan must build on these landed owners instead of proposing them
again:

- B01-B05 established stable client spell-display metadata, non-throwing
  desktop sound cleanup, Ant server build authority, changed-code static
  analysis, and bounded/redacted social/offline-message failure handling.
- B06 put auxiliary client types in correctly named files without prematurely
  changing their packages.
- B07 created `OpenGLViewportPresenter` and `OpenGLWindowController` while
  retaining frame/GL/composite coordination in `OpenGLFramePresenter` and the
  active software fallback in `ScaledWindow`.
- B08 created `MovementSnapshotDiagnostics` and `SceneBaselineState` while
  retaining protocol reads and client mutation order in `PacketHandler`.
- B09 created `ClientDefinitionRegistry`, `PrayerBookDefinitions`, and
  `ClientDefinitionFallbackDiagnostics` while retaining `EntityHandler` as the
  compatibility facade and authored/load-order owner.
- B10 created pure equipment slot/stat and spell classification/validation
  owners while retaining mutable container, packet, combat, and scheduling
  authority in `Equipment` and `SpellHandler`.
- B11 proved and labeled active client roots and compatibility surfaces. It
  removed only proved-dead archive writers and stale IDE metadata; protocols,
  plugins, both databases, the legacy archive, active desktop/mobile interface
  hooks, software presentation, hidden surface aliases, and uncertain MySQL
  helpers remain.

These boundaries are evidence for incremental ownership extraction. They are
not permission to remove compatibility facades or relocate whole package trees.

## Target Ownership Map

This is the direction to move toward. It does not require a single giant folder
rename. Start by extracting classes into clear ownership boundaries inside the
existing source roots.

## Migration Phases

### Phase 0: Guardrails Before Moving Code

Status: **complete and continuously enforced**.

- Confirm hosted server launch safety exists and refuses unsafe worktrees.
- Ensure `run-hosted-server.sh` can only run the public server from the clean
  live-main worktree.
- Ensure local/dev server commands do not silently look like the hosted server.
- Add a status command or checklist that reports running server PID, worktree,
  branch, commit, config file, database, and port.
- Add loud labels to startup output so `Spoiled Milk LIVE/HOSTED` and private
  dev servers are visually distinct.
- Keep dev/refactor server ports and database names obvious. A local server
  should never trick a tester into thinking they are logging into the live
  alpha database.
- Add/update docs before moving files.
- Record the current source roots and compatibility exceptions.
- Do not restructure while the public server is running from a dirty branch.

These guardrails are in place through the workspace/manager/live scripts and
documentation. Every later phase must keep them passing; completion does not
make them optional.

### Phase 1: Behavior-Preserving Extractions

Status: **in progress**. B06-B10 completed the first focused ownership
boundaries. B07 completed viewport/window work; the next five branches are the
ordered `mudclient` sequence below.

Keep Java packages mostly stable. Extract focused classes from oversized files
without changing runtime behavior.

Completed/active examples:

- `OpenGLFramePresenter` into LWJGL bindings, shader program, viewport,
  window, chunk renderer, shadows, frame capture, and input. Remaining
  sprite-composite/resource coordination is deferred until after the current
  `mudclient` sequence.
- `PacketHandler` diagnostic state, client definition registry/prayer/fallback
  state, and pure server equipment/spell decisions are extracted as recorded
  above.
- `mudclient` now proceeds through renderer settings, profile application,
  active legacy software scaling, external asset loading, and scene-instance
  storage. The detailed branch boundaries live in
  [`code-cleanup-and-modularization-plan.md`](code-cleanup-and-modularization-plan.md#ordered-post-b11-implementation-branches).
- `World` into sector cache, terrain/wall/roof builders, minimap, collision,
  and renderer chunk export.
- `RenderTelemetry` into frame, scene, world, sprite, shadow, CPU, and memory
  categories behind a small facade.

Phase 1 exit gate for the immediate sequence:

1. All five new owners have focused automated characterization and changed-code
   analysis.
2. Each renderer-facing branch has recorded owner confirmation from private
   visual testing; screenshots are not required.
3. OpenGL-primary and software-fallback ownership remain distinct and working.
4. No branch changes protocol, server authority, asset identity/order, scene
   mutation order, or player-facing defaults under cover of extraction.
5. A refreshed dependency map identifies every temporary `mudclient` facade
   that Phase 2 would need to move or retain.

### Phase 2: Package Ownership

Status: **deferred until the Phase 1 exit gate above is complete**.

After extracted classes compile and behave correctly, move them into clearer
packages such as:

- `orsc.renderer.opengl`
- `orsc.renderer.lighting`
- `orsc.renderer.shadows`
- `orsc.renderer.sprites`
- `orsc.renderer.telemetry`
- `orsc.client.ui`
- `orsc.client.assets`
- `orsc.client.world`

This phase should be mechanical. If behavior changes are needed, do them in a
separate follow-up commit.

Do not move one of the five immediate owners into a speculative final package
on its extraction branch. Keep package `orsc` or the current established
package first, learn its real dependencies, and then move related stable owners
together through small mechanical package branches.

### Phase 3: Legacy Quarantine

Status: **partially labeled, not authorized for deletion**. B11 clarified the
active compatibility boundaries; branch 3 of the immediate sequence will move
software-scaler ownership without retiring it.

Move compatibility-only code into clearly named legacy areas and comment why it
still exists.

Targets:

- software renderer scaling — active maintained fallback; extract and label,
  do not delete
- hidden render-surface aliases — active saved-setting migration; keep out of
  the player selector
- retired graphics rows/toggles — prevent reintroduction; do not confuse their
  absence with dead runtime camera/tone/font compatibility
- obsolete launch wrappers
- archived OpenRSC configs and launchers
- compatibility-only item/content families

The important rule is that future AI sessions should not see old scaling,
resolution, or renderer paths and assume they are active remaster systems.

### Phase 4: Top-Level Folder Renames

Status: **deferred**. Do not begin until the five immediate owners, Phase 2
package moves, and build/release impact inventory are complete.

Only consider top-level folder renames after extraction and package ownership
are stable. Renaming `Client_Base` and `PC_Client` too early risks breaking
build scripts, release packaging, and inherited assumptions before the code is
ready.

Possible final names:

- `client/common` for current `Client_Base`
- `client/desktop` for current `PC_Client`
- `server` stays `server`
- `tools`, `scripts`, `tests`, and `docs` stay as they are

### Phase 5: Prune Or Archive

Status: **proof-only candidates remain**. B11 completed its bounded proof and
retained everything whose operational or compatibility use was uncertain.

Once the new structure is proven through builds, client launch, packaged launch,
and hosted-server checks:

- delete unused compatibility wrappers
- move historical references to `docs/inherited-openrsc/`
- remove generated files that are no longer source-of-truth
- simplify release packaging paths
- update contributor docs so new work lands in the new ownership areas

## Visual And Runtime Checkpoints

Before any hosted restart:

- `git status --short --branch` in the live worktree shows clean detached
  `HEAD`
- live worktree commit matches the published `spoiled-milk/main` selected for
  deployment
- startup output says it is using `myworld-host.conf`
- startup output says it connected to `spoiled_milk_alpha.db`
- `live-status.sh` verifies the launch attestation, database symlink, and
  database file descriptor
- public port `43605` belongs to the hosted server process
- no manager or AI worker worktree has a server process bound to the public
  player port

Before any dev/refactor launch:

- startup output says private/dev/refactor explicitly
- the database name is not `spoiled_milk_alpha.db`
- the server is stopped after testing unless the user explicitly asks to keep it
  running
- the final status message says which server, if any, is still running

After each renderer-facing extraction:

- login screen graphic appears correctly
- 4:3 and 16:9 aspect settings work
- borderless on/off works through the packaged launcher
- player/NPC sprites occlude correctly behind walls and scenery
- ground items, projectiles, and scenery animations render
- roofs hide/show without breaking scenery
- day/night tones, fog, skybox, glow, contact shadows, and directional shadows
  still work
- F6 simple/expanded debug still reports useful values
- player movement, NPC movement, combat, teleporting, and region loading still
  behave normally

After each server-facing extraction:

- generator checks pass
- build server succeeds
- login works with the expected client build
- item/NPC definition max IDs match the packaged client release
- no dev-only branch is used to start the public hosted server

## Stop Conditions

Stop and reassess before continuing if any of these happen:

- there is any uncertainty about which server, database, branch, or worktree is
  active
- hosted server would need to run from the refactor branch
- a moved file requires unrelated gameplay changes to compile
- a compatibility system looks unused but has not been checked against scripts,
  configs, saved settings, and release packaging
- an ownership extraction starts requiring package moves or a
  `Client_Base`/`PC_Client` rename before the five-owner Phase 1 gate is complete
- a visual-risk renderer extraction fails more than twice
- git status contains unrelated user changes in files that the refactor needs
  to rewrite

The project is in alpha, so large structural swings are allowed. The safety
requirement is that each swing has a clear owner, a clean rollback point, and no
path to accidentally becoming the live hosted server before approval.
