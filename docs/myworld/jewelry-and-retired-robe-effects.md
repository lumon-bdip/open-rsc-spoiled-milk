# Jewelry and Retired Robe Effects

This document records cloth effects retired from robes and the implemented
altar-jewelry runtime behavior.

## Retired Robe Effects

These effects are retired from cloth armor. Cloth armor should focus on magic
defense and matching-rune preservation.

- Air: no runtime special beyond the old defense split.
- Water: no runtime special beyond the old defense split.
- Earth: no runtime special beyond the old defense split.
- Fire: per-piece magic-defense bonus.
- Mind: reduced incoming debuff strength.
- Body: faster hitpoint restoration.
- Cosmic: chance to reroll a defensive roll.
- Chaos: reflected damage.
- Law: incoming damage smoothing through extra damage rolls.
- Nature: flat poison tick damage mitigation.
- Death: increased defenses while missing health.
- Blood: lifesteal from spell damage.
- Soul: rechargeable damage shield.
- Life: no established robe-specific runtime effect.

## Superseded Design Notes

Earlier robe-to-necklace candidates, elemental jewelry drafts, and necklace
rune-preservation concepts are retired. Cloth and matching staves own rune
preservation in the live model; the jewelry catalog below is the active
runtime source of truth.

## Current Jewelry Effects

Implementation status:

- Implemented: elemental ring/necklace offense, elemental amulet defense, mind
  ring/necklace crafting XP, mind amulet combat XP, body ring/necklace
  gathering XP, body amulet discipline XP, cosmic ring wealth rolls, cosmic necklace standard loot
  rolls, cosmic amulet rare gathering duplication, chaos recoil, chaos necklace
  chain lightning, chaos amulet random rune production, nature food healing, nature amulet poison decay, law ring skilling
  banking, law necklace monster-loot banking, law amulet teleports, death
  low-health scaling and death burst, blood max Hits and lifesteal, soul item
  saving/life saving, and life summon bonuses.
- Scrapped in runtime: nature ring iron-smelting protection and old cosmic
  amulet normal-resource duplication.
- Item names and examine descriptions now match the implemented effects in the
  server data and client fallback definitions.

  tier chance to reroll the monster drop.
- Necklace: `10%` per tier chance to roll an extra standard monster drop. Rare
  tables are suppressed on this extra roll.

Amulet:

  chance to double that rare item.

- Reflected damage improves when both are worn:
  - one piece: reflect `damage / 10`
  - ring plus necklace: reflect `damage / 5`
- Example: tier 5 ring plus tier 5 necklace gives `80%` recoil chance and
  reflects `damage / 5`.

Amulet:

- `15%` chance per tier that damage dealt also deals half that damage,
  rounded up, to a random enemy within `4` tiles.
- The second-hit target pool can include the player's current target.

### Law

  - tier 1: `50`
  - tier 2: `150`
  - tier 3: `300`
  - tier 4: `500`
  - tier 5: `750`
- Ring: transports skilling drops to the bank.
- Necklace: transports monster loot to the bank.
- Each transported item consumes one charge.
- If a gathering action produces 5 ore, it consumes 5 charges.
- Transport all non-stackable items to the bank.
- Stackable items are not transported by this effect because they do not
  clog inventory in the same way.
- Examples:
  - Woodcutting: logs transport, seeds do not.
  - Mining: ores and gems transport.

Amulet:

- Keep current direct guild teleport utility.
- Current behavior: 3 charges, recharged at the Law altar, destination pair
  determined by gem tier.

  - tier 4: `+1` weapon power for every `10%` below max health.
  - tier 5: `+2` weapon power for every `10%` below max health.
- Death necklace:
  - same scaling concept as the ring, but grants defenses instead of weapon
    power.

- Whenever an enemy dies, nearby enemies take damage based on their own maximum
  health.
