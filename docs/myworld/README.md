This folder keeps only the active MyWorld documentation surface.
The public project overview and player-facing feature summary now live in the

## Current Repository Shape

Active MyWorld workflow:

- `Makefile`: root MyWorld task aliases.
- `scripts/`: current build, check, run, reset, test, and benchmark wrappers.
- `tools/generators/`: authored generated-data sources and generator code.
- `tools/benchmarks/`: current benchmark helpers.
- `tests/myworld/`: current MyWorld validation suite.
- `docs/releases/`: player packaging, hosted-alpha, and publication checklists.
- `server/myworld.conf`: active local server config.
- `server/connections.conf`: required shared connection config.
- `server/inc/sqlite/myworld_seed.db`: canonical local SQLite seed.
- `server/inc/sqlite/myworld_dev.db`: local dev database state.
- `server/plugins/com/openrsc/server/plugins/custom/myworld/`: preferred namespace for MyWorld-owned runtime content.

Compatibility areas:

- `dev/myworld/`: compatibility wrappers for older local commands. Its
  `assets/` subtree remains the active visual asset source loaded by the
  client. New tools, tests, and planning docs should not be added there.
- Broad inherited server/client packages can still be changed when needed, but new MyWorld-specific handlers should prefer `custom/myworld`.

Archived reference:

- `docs/myworld/archive/`: old MyWorld planning docs and detailed audits.
- `docs/inherited-openrsc/`: inherited OpenRSC/Cabbage docs, launchers, configs, SQLite seeds, and Make recipes.

## Validation

Use these before and after structural cleanup:

```bash
make check
python3 ./tests/myworld/test-standalone-layout.py
make build-server
```

Run the full suite when local ports are clear:

```bash
make test
```
