## Jewelry Testing Status

Confirmed working:
- Elemental rings and necklaces apply flat offensive power bonuses.
- Mind jewelry effects are working.
- Body jewelry effects are working.
- Nature jewelry effects are working.
- Blood jewelry effects are working.
- Death jewelry effects are working. Death rings build charge from NPC kills
  and spend that charge as yellow bonus damage against NPCs. Death amulets
  build death charge and spend it on area Burst damage.
- Chaos recoil and chaos amulet splash are working.
- Law ring and necklace banking are working, with charge display/depletion.
- Soul ring lifesaving, necklace item-saving, and amulet healing Burst are
  working. Soul Burst charge persists through the player cache, keyed by amulet
  item ID.
- Cosmic jewelry is working. Bounty amulets do not increase the chance to find
  a mining gem; they only double a rare gathering reward after it drops.

Pending:
- Consider a deterministic cosmic test command if field testing the amulet is
  too slow.

## Bank Shortcuts

- In the custom bank, `Ctrl` plus left-click on a bank item withdraws its full
  available quantity, subject to inventory capacity.
- `Ctrl` plus left-click on an inventory item while the custom bank is open
  deposits all copies of that item.
- Equipment mode retains its direct equip click behavior.
