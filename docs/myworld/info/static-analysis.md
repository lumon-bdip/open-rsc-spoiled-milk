# Static Analysis Baseline

## Contract

Static analysis protects new and changed code without requiring a repository-
wide cleanup. Existing whole-program javac and SpotBugs findings are stored as
stable fingerprints. Checkstyle, PMD, ShellCheck, and Ruff fail only when a
finding intersects lines added or changed relative to the selected Git base.
CPD is report-only.

SpotBugs reads the exact Ant-built jars and uses their dependency classpaths,
but `-onlyAnalyze` is limited to the maintained `orsc`/`com.openrsc`
application packages. Vendored classes merged into the client and server fat
jars are type-resolution inputs, not repository-owned findings.
The initial include filter is limited to correctness and multithreaded-
correctness categories plus reviewed equals/hashCode, swallowed-failure,
broad-catch, and resource-lifecycle patterns. Style, performance, exposure,
internationalization, and unused-code findings remain outside this gate.

No formatter runs, no generated source is rewritten, and no analyzer result is
evidence that a reflection target, plugin, protocol implementation, asset, or
configuration-only feature is dead.

## Scope

| Product | Java roots | Ant build | SpotBugs input |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Desktop client | `Client_Base/src`, `PC_Client/src` | `scripts/build-client.sh` | `Client_Base/Open_RSC_Client.jar` |
| Server | `server/src`, `server/plugins` | `scripts/build-server.sh` | `server/core.jar`, `server/plugins.jar` |
| World Builder tools | `tools/world-builder/src` | `scripts/build-world-builder-tools.sh` | `output/world-builder-tools/world-builder-tools.jar` |

`tools/myworld/ExportBasicProjectileSheets.java` is source-analyzed when it
changes, but is not a compiled product because it has no maintained build
contract. Maintained Python under `scripts`, `tests/myworld`, and
`tools/generators` is checked. Maintained shell files outside the excluded
roots are checked, including player and World Builder release launchers.

The default exclusions are:

- `legacy/`;
- bundled tools under `tools/vendor/` and `server/inc/ant/`;
- build output and ignored local state;
- the generated Java catalogs enumerated in `scripts/lint.py`.

World Builder process, transaction, packaging, and editor tests are dedicated
suites. They are not transitively covered by `tests/myworld/test-all.sh`.

## Toolchain And Runtime

`config/static-analysis/tools.json` pins the exact Checkstyle, PMD, SpotBugs,
ShellCheck, and Ruff release assets and SHA-256 digests. Downloads are stored
outside Git under `${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-~/.cache}/spoiled-milk/static-analysis`.
Override that path with `SPOILED_MILK_LINT_CACHE`.

The production compilation lane remains Java 8 with source/target 1.8. The
analysis tools run under Java 21 or newer; set `ANALYSIS_JAVA_HOME` when Java
21 is not the current runtime. Analyzer runtime selection does not change the
produced bytecode target.

Prepare and prove the cache:

```bash
./scripts/lint.sh bootstrap
./scripts/lint.sh bootstrap --offline
./scripts/lint.sh self-test --offline
```

The self-test feeds deliberate violations to every configured analyzer and
fails unless each tool detects its fixture.

## Normal Use

Build all products with full compiler warnings and enforce only new gated
warning fingerprints:

```bash
./scripts/lint.sh compiler --base spoiled-milk/main
```

Analyze the existing Ant-built jars and changed source lines:

```bash
./scripts/lint.sh analyze --base spoiled-milk/main
```

Run both phases locally:

```bash
./scripts/lint.sh all --base spoiled-milk/main
```

Use `--offline` after the verified cache is populated. Machine-readable XML,
JSON, logs, fingerprints, and run metadata are written beneath
`output/static-analysis/` by default. `--reports` may select another ignored
output directory.

For an occasional full, report-only source scan plus whole-program comparison:

```bash
./scripts/lint.sh report --base spoiled-milk/main
```

## Baseline Updates

Baseline replacement is always explicit:

```bash
./scripts/lint.sh compiler --update-baseline
./scripts/lint.sh analyze --update-baseline
```

The first command replaces only the selected javac warning fingerprints. The
second replaces only the SpotBugs fingerprints and requires current Ant-built
artifacts. Review every addition and removal. A finding should leave the
baseline in the same focused commit that fixes it; never regenerate either
file merely to make CI pass.

Fingerprint paths and members intentionally make moves visible. Renaming a
file or member with an unresolved finding creates a new fingerprint that
requires review rather than silently carrying or discarding the exception.

## CI Lanes

`.github/workflows/static-analysis.yml` has two jobs:

1. Java 8 runs the three authoritative Ant builds with `-Xlint:all`, compares
   the compiler baseline, runs the repository contract test, and uploads the
   exact jars.
2. Java 21 downloads those jars, verifies the cached tools with intentional
   fixtures, enforces changed-line source checks, compares SpotBugs results,
   and uploads all reports even when a gate fails.

Existing findings remain visible in reports but do not block unrelated work.
Formatting, dependency upgrades, warning cleanup, and analyzer-rule expansion
remain separate follow-up branches.
