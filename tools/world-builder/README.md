# World Builder Tools

This module owns standalone World Builder project discovery, manifests,
workspace management, export, import, rollback, and launch supervision as
those phases are implemented.

Read-only target discovery remains available independently:

```bash
./scripts/build-world-builder-tools.sh
java -jar output/world-builder-tools/world-builder-tools.jar discover \
  --server-root /path/to/private-server
```

Discovery supports the versioned `spoiled-milk-repository-v1` layout and
writes its deterministic source manifest to standard output. It does not
create a workspace or change the target.

The Phase 1 runtime can prepare an isolated workspace and launch the local
Builder server/client pair:

```bash
./scripts/build-server.sh
./scripts/build-client.sh
./scripts/build-world-builder-tools.sh

java -jar output/world-builder-tools/world-builder-tools.jar launch \
  --server-root /path/to/private-server \
  --runtime-root /path/to/world-builder-release \
  --workspace /path/to/world-builder-project \
  --port 43615
```

`prepare` accepts the same arguments but stops after staging. `run` starts an
existing prepared workspace with `--workspace`; it reads the recorded port
from `runtime.json`. An explicit matching `--port` remains available for
diagnostics.

Preparation never replaces an existing workspace. It records the target's
verified authored files under immutable-by-contract `<workspace>/source` and
creates the complete runnable copy under `<workspace>/working`. The working
tree receives a clean Builder database, no generated client identity or
connection files, and a loopback-only configuration before the project is
published atomically. Launch re-verifies every source-snapshot hash and refuses
added, changed, missing, or symlinked source files. The target private-server
tree is read-only throughout preparation and use.

The Builder server receives the canonical workspace root explicitly and
refuses to start from any directory other than `<workspace>/working/server`.
Terrain, scenery, NPC overlays, the client terrain mirror, and terrain backups
all resolve through that validated context. The editor shows the project folder
name, source revision, and current saved/unsaved state.

The launcher keeps logs under `<workspace>/logs`, active PID files and the
last-run receipt under `<workspace>/run`, and refuses a second process for the
same workspace. Closing the client requests an orderly local server shutdown.
Generated credentials are never printed or placed in manifests.

After closing the Builder, export the saved working map with explicit release
provenance:

```bash
java -jar output/world-builder-tools/world-builder-tools.jar export \
  --workspace /path/to/world-builder-project \
  --builder-version v0.2.39 \
  --source-commit 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567
```

Export revalidates the immutable source snapshot, working layout, matching
server/client terrain archives, and all four authored JSON overlays. A changed
project publishes atomically under `<workspace>/exports/export-<fingerprint>`.
The directory contains only the canonical five authored files, a strict v1
manifest, and a readable change summary. Identical input and provenance reuse
the byte-identical verified export; no-op projects report `no-changes` without
creating an export. Active Builder sessions, source drift, malformed input,
unsafe paths, incomplete data, and tampered existing exports are refused.

Preview an import while the target private server is offline:

```bash
java -jar output/world-builder-tools/world-builder-tools.jar import \
  --workspace /path/to/world-builder-project \
  --export /path/to/world-builder-project/exports/export-0123456789abcdef \
  --target-root /path/to/private-server \
  --dry-run
```

After reviewing the exact additions/replacements, repeat with `--apply` in
place of `--dry-run`. Apply reserves the configured server port for the whole
transaction, rechecks the source revision, writes a pending receipt, verifies
backups and same-filesystem staging, replaces in deterministic order, and
marks success only after reopening every installed file. Any partial failure
restores the prior bytes and prior file absence before reporting failure.

Preview or apply the newest eligible receipt-based undo with:

```bash
java -jar output/world-builder-tools/world-builder-tools.jar undo-import \
  --workspace /path/to/world-builder-project \
  --target-root /path/to/private-server \
  --dry-run
```

Use `--apply` only after reviewing the undo. Undo refuses if any installed file
changed after import, safeguards the installed state, restores the exact prior
state, and records a successful rollback receipt. There is intentionally no
force option.

Packaged launchers use two human-oriented commands so shell and Windows batch
files do not parse transaction JSON or duplicate safety logic:

```bash
java -jar world-builder-tools.jar export-import \
  --workspace /path/to/world-builder-project \
  --target-root /path/to/private-server \
  --builder-version v0.1.0 \
  --source-commit 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567

java -jar world-builder-tools.jar undo-latest-import \
  --workspace /path/to/world-builder-project \
  --target-root /path/to/private-server
```

The first command exports saved working data, prints the full import preview,
and requires the exact confirmation `IMPORT`. The second prints the rollback
preview and requires `UNDO`. Empty input or any other response cancels without
changing the target. Both retain the same offline, revision, backup, receipt,
and changed-after-import protections as the lower-level commands.

The manifest schemas in `schema/` are release contracts. Add a new schema
version instead of changing the meaning of an existing version.
